# Hi there!

This is still work-in-progress, but the `couchdb_user` module in the `lib/` folder 
should be feature complete and ready to go. 

I'm still working on the documentation and some integration tests. But if the lack 
of those doesn't bother you, feel free to give it a try!
 
Feedback, feature requests and bug reports are welcome!
